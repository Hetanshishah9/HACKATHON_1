Universal Switch Set adds data encryption and decryption to legacy systems, ensuring secure data transmission without costly upgrades. It supports industry-standard encryption, key management, and seamless integration, protecting sensitive data while maintaining operational efficiency.

Overview
The Universal Switch Set is designed to enhance the security of legacy applications lacking modern cyber safety measures. By integrating data encryption and decryption, this system ensures secure data transmission without requiring expensive infrastructure upgrades.

Problem Statement
Legacy systems are often vulnerable to cyber threats due to outdated or missing security protocols. Retrofitting these systems with modern encryption standards is challenging and costly. Our Universal Switch Set provides a cost-effective solution to secure data transmission in legacy applications, preventing unauthorized access while ensuring data integrity.

Key Features
Seamless Integration: Easily integrates with various legacy systems and protocols, requiring minimal configuration.
Data Encryption & Decryption: Ensures secure transmission by encrypting data before sending and decrypting it upon receipt.
Customizable Configuration: Supports a range of encryption standards and is adaptable to different data formats.
Robust Key Management: Securely generates, stores, and distributes encryption keys to authorized users.
Cost-Effective Security: Provides enhanced security without the need for costly upgrades or replacements.
Architecture
Encryption/Decryption Engines: Modular components that handle the secure transmission of data.
Key Management System: Manages the generation, storage, and distribution of encryption keys.
Integration Interface: Standardized interface for seamless integration into legacy applications.
How It Works
Encryption: Before data transmission, the switch set encrypts sensitive information using industry-standard algorithms.
Key Input: The sender and receiver both input matching encryption keys.
Transmission: Data is transmitted securely. If the keys match, the data is decrypted at the receiverâ€™s end. If not, the data is dropped.
Notification: If transmission fails due to a key mismatch, the sender is notified.
